Lithophane tealight holder

Design inspired by [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4682260).
I used [itslitho](https://tool.itslitho.com/CreateModel) to generate lithophanes with the following settings:
- Shape: Arc
- Height: 100 mm (shouldn't matter as long as it's equal between all images)
- Crop: enabled
- Width: 70 mm
- Andle: 90 Deg (90 Deg for 4 pictures, 60 Deg for 6, etc..)
- Max Thick: 3.2 mm

- Frame: Frame
- Thickness: 3 mm
- Depth: 4 mm

Design is parametric and can be easily tweaked to fit pictures with different diameters and thicknesses.
