Mini precision screwdriver handle with integrated 16 bit holder. Based around a 4mm x 115mm magnetic screw bit extender and 5mm x 2mm disc magnets.

Inspired by [my previous attempt](/precision_screwdriver) and work from [Fjederhaek](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4399253).

#### Parts
- 8x 5x2mm round magnets
- 1x magnetic screw bit extender 115~150mm total length (shorter is better)

#### Assembly
Magnets should stay in place without glue.
Use a rubber mallet to insert the bit extender in the handle
