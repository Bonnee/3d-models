Mini precision screwdriver with integrated 16 bit holder. Based around a 6.35mm x 115mm magnetic screw bit extender and 5mm x 2mm disc magnets. Model is parametric and can easily be adapted to different shaft lengths and magnet sizes.  

Inspired by [my previous attempt](/precision_screwdriver) and work from [Fjederhaek](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4399253).
